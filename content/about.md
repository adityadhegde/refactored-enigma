Hey there! I’m Aditya Hegde, a data scientist with a background in statistics and over three years of experience in tech. I’ve worked in business analysis and intelligence, dealing with robotics enabled e-commerce operations and third party seller seller services, and now I’m diving into the world of unstructured data in the financial sector as a data scientist.

### What to Expect Here

I started this blog to share what I’ve learned and to connect with others in the data community. You’ll find videos and articles where I break down complex ideas, share practical tips, and talk about the latest developments.

### A Bit More About Me

When I’m not in front of a computer screen, I love cycling, sipping on good coffee, and hanging out with my cats. I’m also into audiobooks and podcasts.
