# What I want to achieve
I am a man who enjoys the simple things in life, a giant computer monitor, and things like atmospheric lights which will react to 
the videos playing on the said monitor. Ofcourse I could buy something akin to that off the [internet](https://us.govee.com/products/govee-tv-backlight-3-lite?Size=For%2075-85%20inch%20TVs&Version=DUNE-themed%20Packaging).

This product was unavailable on [Amazon India](https://www.amazon.in) so with the exchange rate being what it isand 
the customs fees it would be would prohibitively expensive, and extremely boring. So I decided to make some of my own.

Here's what the final product should look like,

</div>

So ofcourse I spent the next entire weekend obsessing over how can I make this happen, while making it as cost effective as possible.

## The plan

So roughly I need to the following:

1. Capture a screenshot of what's playing
2. Analyse the image and turn it into colors which represent it
3. Send it over to a micro controller which controls a LED strip

This process needs to be repeated as often as possible to provide a seamless experience.

### What's required

1. lights ws2812b
2. Microcontroller
3. A way to communicate to the microcontroller
4. A way to Decode what's on the screen

## Hardware side of things 
How to connect the lights to the micro controller
How to power the micro controller 

## How to communicate with the microcontroller over the Wifi
### Setting up the microcontroller with micropython
### Primer on controlling LEDs using micropython
### Connecting it to the wifi
### Setting up a server with takes a command using a get request

#### Problems
### Approach two [Slats]
#### Calculating colors with weighted average
