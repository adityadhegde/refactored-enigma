# What I want to achieve
I am a man who enjoys the simple things in life, a giant computer monitor, and things like atmospheric lights which will react to 
the videos playing on the said monitor. Ofcourse I could buy something akin to that off the [internet](https://us.govee.com/products/govee-tv-backlight-3-lite?Size=For%2075-85%20inch%20TVs&Version=DUNE-themed%20Packaging).

With the going exchange rate and the customs fees it would be would prohibitively expensive, and extremely boring. 
So I decided to make some of my own.

Here's what the final product should look like,

So ofcourse I spent the next entire weekend obsessing over how can I make this happen, while making it as cheap as possible.
