# What I want to achieve
lights which react to what's playing on the screen
[Example 1]
what's available in the market as a plug and play solution
[Example 2]
How will I achieve it

## What's required
1. lights ws2812b
2. Microcontroller
3. A way to communicate to the microcontroller
4. A way to Decode what's on the screen

## Hardware side of things 
How to connect the lights to the micro controller
How to power the micro controller 

## How to communicate with the microcontroller over the Wifi
### Setting up the microcontroller with micropython
### Primer on controlling LEDs using micropython
### Connecting it to the wifi
### Setting up a server with takes a command using a get request
