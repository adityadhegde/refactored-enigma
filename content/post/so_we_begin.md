## The Goal
Along my learning journey, it became clear that there exists "hello world" tutorial for every conceivable topic in data science, a practice which is counterproductive at best as it obfuscates intricacies and subtleties of the field. What I intend to do here is to move away from the mundane and tackle more obscure challenges. 

As my education progressed, I realized that there are countless "hello world" examples for data science topics available, a tactic that can be detrimental since it masks the field's complexities. My goal here is to shift focus from routine exercises and delve into lesser-known problems.

This revised version maintains the original meaning while blending formal and informal language for an even tone when spoken aloud.
